# Overview of my Code
The Ulam's Spiral Code:
Creates an n by n spiral and then either removes all prime or perfect numbers. It then plots this as an image

The Knight Movement Code:
Creates a n by n spiral and then creates a pattern by calculating how a knight would move if it could only travel to the 
smallest square it hadn't yet visited. It then plots the knights journey on top of a numberspiral as well as where exactly the knight lands 
and the knights starting and end points
